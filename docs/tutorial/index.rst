Tutorial
========

This tutorial will walk you from Hello World through building a fully-featured quotes application. Users will be able to register, log in, create quotes and manage their favorites.

.. FIXME: The tutorial project code is available on GitHub.

It is assumed you're already familiar with:

- Python 3.7+. The `official tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_ is a great way to learn or review.
- The Jinja2 templating engine. See the `official docs <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/templates/>`_ for more info.
