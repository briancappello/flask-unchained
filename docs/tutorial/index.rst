Tutorial
========

This tutorial will walk you through creating a basic portfolio application for monitoring your investments. Users will be able to register, log in, create portfolios and manage the stocks in them. You will be able to package and install the application on other computers.

.. FIXME: The tutorial project code is available on GitHub.

It is assumed you're already familiar with:

- Python 3.6+. The `official tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_ is a great way to learn or review.
- The Jinja2 templating engine. See the `official docs <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/templates/>`_ for more info.
